        <div className="my-5 mx-5 text-xs sm:text-xl text-gray-400">
          During my military service, I served as a software developer, where I
          was responsible for developing a range of applications including
          desktop applications using C#, and mobile apps using Python or Java.
          My primary focus was full-stack web development, using React and
          Next.js for the frontend, and Node.js for the backend. I also worked
          extensively with MongoDB and PostgreSQL as database solutions.
          Throughout my service, I led multiple projects from concept to
          deployment.

            Worked on a year-long project where we provided weekly progress
            updates and developed the product from the ground up to completion.
            The final product, built with React, Node.js, and MongoDB, is still
            actively used by the Technion today.
